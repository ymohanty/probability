# Mathematical background for statisticians and economic theorists

These are an incomplete set of [notes](https://github.com/ymohanty/probability/raw/lyx2tex/main.pdf) compiled from multiple classes at Yale and Uchicago, along with independent study, that constitute part of the background in analysis and probability that are necessary for beginning graduate students in economic theory, econometrics, and mathematical statistics. The draft is currently incomplete and results contained within have not been proofread carefully by others; if you find any typos or other errors, please raise an Issue. 

## Building the book

You should have a full TeX distribution installed. See [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) for MacOS, [MikTex](https://miktex.org/) for Windows, and [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) for any Linux distro.

Ensure that "pdflatex" is on the Path for your default shell and then run

```
> cd probability
> pdflatex main.tex
```
