# Yale MA330 Course Notes: Advanced Probability

These are an incomplete set of [notes](https://github.com/ymohanty/probability/raw/lyx/main.pdf) from the Spring 2020 class on probability theory at Yale, as taught by Prof. Sekhar Tatikonda. 
Much of the material is based on David Pollard's seminal *A User's Guide to Measure Theoretic Probability*. Some of the material in these notes has been rearranged for organization, 
and I have added additional material which I thought was important but was not covered in the class due to time.
