\begin_layout Standard
Formal probability theory is often described as measure theory (or more
 generally, analysis) on measure spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\measurespace$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\left(\X\right)=1$
\end_inset

 and to a certain extent the foundational theory does resemble this characteriza
tion.
 However probability itself is distinct from foundational probability 
\emph on
theory
\emph default
, in that its goals and aims are to solve problems that are of a fundamentally
 different character than problems seen in analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probability as as subject has a strong combinatorial flavor, since it owes
 its origins to gambling and games of chance considered by amateur mathematician
s in the 17th and 18th centuries.
 These classical ideas still permeate the modern 
\emph on
probabilistic way of thinking.

\emph default
 As such, it would be useful to revise the basic combinatorial tools that
 are indispensable when tackling problems of this nature.
 These are discussed in Appendix

\begin_layout Standard
In general, we can say that probability theory 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has a right hand and a left hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The right hand is the rigorous measure-theoretic axiomatization that one
 encounters in a course on probability theory.
 The left hand is the probablistic intuition that one develops through trying
 to model stochastic phenomena with the aforementioned probabilistic way
 of thinking.
 Probabilists aim to be ambidextrous in this regard, using the axiomatic
 framework of probability theory to deduce facts about processes whose parts
 and subparts can be reduced to “naïve” probabilistic concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to cover both parts of probability adequately, we will use the
 background in analysis developed in Part I of these notes to prove general
 theorems, while using numerous examples to develop probabilistic intuition.
 I hope that the combination of theory and examples prove sufficient in
 painting a vivid picture of probability theory, with a view towards application
s in statistics and economics.

\begin_layout Section
Probability spaces and probability measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While formal probability theory is based on measure theory, the language
 of probability theory is different.
 To start our exploration into probability theory, we shall first have to
 translate a lot of the basic terminology of measure theory into the langauge
 of probability.
 To begin with, we specialize the notion of a measure space 
\begin_inset Formula $\measurespace$
\end_inset

 to a probability space 
\begin_inset Formula $\probabilityspace$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(\Omega\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 Measurable sets 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\F$
\end_inset

 are called 
\emph on
events 
\emph default
in the language of probability.
 The basic properties of probability measures carry over from Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "chap:measures"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

; we list a few more for completeness.

\end_inset

Three numbers are chosen at random from 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,2,\ldots,10\}$
\end_inset

 without replacement.
 What is the probability that the minimum of the chosen numbers is 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 or their maximum is 
\begin_inset Formula $7$
\end_inset

 ? Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be the event that we select three numbers with minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 be the event that we select three numbers with maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $7$
\end_inset

.
 We want 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(A\cup B\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(A\right)+\mathbb{P}\left(B\right)-\mathbb{P}\left(A\cap B\right).$
\end_inset

 We need to compute each component.
 To compute the first term, note that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\begin{array}{c}
7\\
2
\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset

 ways to pick 2 numbers without replacement after fixing the first one at
 3 since we are picking only from the remaining numbers which are greater
 than three.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(A\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
7\\
2
\end{array}\right)/\left(\begin{array}{c}
10\\
3
\end{array}\right).$
\end_inset

 Similarly, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(B\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
6\\
2
\end{array}\right)/\left(\begin{array}{c}
10\\
3
\end{array}\right).$
\end_inset

 To find the intersection, note that after fixing 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $7$
\end_inset

 there are only 4 choices of the middle number, leaving us with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(A\cap B\right)=$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $4/\left(\begin{array}{c}
10\\
3
\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In sum,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(A\cup B\right) & =\frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}
7\\
2
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{c}
6\\
2
\end{array}\right)-4}{\left(\begin{array}{c}
10\\
3
\end{array}\right)}\\
 & =\frac{21+15-4}{120}\\
 & =\frac{4}{15}.

\begin_layout Section
Independent events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:productMeasures"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 we discussed the notion of product measures; the analagous concept in probabili
ty is that of independence.
 Informally, we think of independent events as those where the occurence
 or non-occurenece of one event does not impact the occurence or non-occurence
 of another.
 We can formalize this idea with the following definition-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "def:independence"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 be an arbitrary index set.
 Then a collection of events
\emph on
 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ A_{i}\right\} _{i\in I}\subset\F$
\end_inset

 are independent if for every finite subset 
\begin_inset Formula $J\subset I$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left[\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}\right]=\prod_{j\in J}\mathbb{P}\left[A_{j}\right].
\]

\end_inset

Two independent events 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B\in\F$
\end_inset

 are often denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $A\indep B$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice how the index set 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 was arbitrary and so we can have countable or uncountable collections of
 independent events.
 Of course, this notion isn't particualrly interesting unless we have some
 rich examples of such events and the probability spaces they live in.
 More generally, we have a question of existence: do independent events
 always exist, no matter the probability space? The answer to this question
 is trivially yes since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(\Omega\cap\emptyset\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(\Omega\right)\mathbb{P}\left(\emptyset\right)=0.$
\end_inset

 So then the question reduces to asking whether 
\emph on
non-trivial 
\emph default
independent events always exist.
 Here of course, the answer is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, since for 
\begin_inset Formula $\F=\left\{ \emptyset,A,A^{C},\Omega\right\} $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\mathbb{P}\left(A\right)<1$
\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(A\cap A^{C}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left(A\right)\mathbb{P}\left(A^{C}\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(A\right)\left(1-\mathbb{P}\left(A\right)\right)\neq0.$
\end_inset

 Nevertheless, we have a rich collection of examples of independent events:
 think about rolling a dice twice and observing a six in each roll; these
 event of seeing a six in the first roll is independent of the event of
 seeing one in the next roll.
 The canonical example of the an infinite collection of independent events
 is given by the following description of an infinitely repeated experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "exa:infinitelyRepeatedExperiment"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 consist of a finite set of outcomes and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=E^{\N}$
\end_inset

 be the collection of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

-valued sequences.
 Thus for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\Omega$
\end_inset

, we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega=\left(\omega_{1},\omega_{2},\ldots\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{i}\in E$
\end_inset

.
 We can then construct the collection
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\omega_{1}^{*},\ldots,\omega_{n}^{*}\right]:=\left\{ \omega\in\Omega\mid\omega_{i}=\omega_{i}^{*},1\leq i\leq n\right\} 
\]

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Two integers 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 are chosen at random with replacement from 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,2,\ldots,9\}$
\end_inset

.
 What is the probabiliy that that 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}-n^{2}$
\end_inset

 is even? First note that 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}-n^{2}=\left(m+n\right)\left(m-n\right)$
\end_inset

 so we need to either 
\begin_inset Formula $m+n$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $m-n$
\end_inset

 to be even.
 For this to be true, both 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 need to be even, or both odd.
 The probability that they are both even is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{4}{9}\times\frac{4}{9}=\frac{16}{81}$
\end_inset

 since sampling without replacement leads to indepenent events.
 The probability that they are both odd is similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{5}{9}\times\frac{5}{9}=\frac{25}{81}.$
\end_inset

 Thus the probability that they are either bothodd or even is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{16+25}{81}=\frac{41}{81}.$
