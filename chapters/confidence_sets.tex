\begin{example}
	\label{exa:isi2009samplepsb10}
	(a) Suppose that the mean of a normal population is unknown. Assuming the population standard deviation to be known, a $100(1-2 \alpha) \%$ confidence interval was calculated for the mean, and its length was found to be $L$. By what factor the sample size needs to be changed to ensure that a $100(1-\alpha) \%$ confidence interval for the same mean will be of length $L / 2$.
	(b) An airlines company experiences that $20 \%$ of the customers who reserve their tickets actually do not show up on the day of the journey. Suppose the capacity of an aircraft is 200 , and the company allows 225 customers to reserve for a flight. What is the probability that the flight will be at least $95 \%$ full? (Use any appropriate approximation and clearly state the relevant result/s.)
